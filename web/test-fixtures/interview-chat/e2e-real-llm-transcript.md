What programming languages do you know?

---

**Sam Kirk:** *(12:49:07 PM)*

I have experience with a variety of programming languages over my career. I have 8+ years of experience with Python, from my time at LTX-Credence where I used it for generating XML timing patterns, to my current consulting work at SAK Consulting where I use it for AI-assisted software development. I also have 15+ years of experience with C, going back to my early days at TRW/Vidar and continuing through positions at Sun Microsystems and Teradyne. I also have experience with C++, which I used at LTX-Credence for implementing timing calibration for an ATE instrument.

I'm also familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, and Go. I'm currently learning Rust.

**Interviewer:** *(12:49:07 PM)*

Tell me about your most recent role.

---

**Sam Kirk:** *(12:49:07 PM)*

Currently, I'm working as Chief Consulting Engineer at SAK Consulting, which I started in March 2022. My focus is on AI-assisted software development and applying generative AI to testing and documentation. I consider this a self-study, graduate-level course on genAI applied to software development, with emphasis on testing and up-to-date documentation.

I've been building a suite of tools using Python, Next.js, Cursor, Claude Code, Vertex AI, and other technologies. Some of my projects include AI-powered tools for hiring managers like "How Do I Fit?", a custom resume generator, and an interactive Q&A chatbot called "Interview Me NOW". I've also created a photo transformation app using Google Gemini and built websites for clients. I'm essentially a journeyman "ChatBot Boss", practicing prompt engineering for software development, testing, and documentation.
