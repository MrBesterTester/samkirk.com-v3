**Sam Kirk:** *(3:29:25 PM)*

Currently, I am working as Chief Consulting Engineer at Samuel A. Kirk Consulting, my own consultancy, which I started in March 2022. My focus is on AI-assisted software development and applying generative AI to testing and documentation. I'm essentially running a self-study, graduate-level course on generative AI applied to software development, with a strong emphasis on testing and creating up-to-date documentation that's useful for both chatbots and developers.

I've been deeply involved in full-stack development, using tools like Cursor and Claude Code to build products that address real-world problems. A significant part of my work involves test automation at all levels of the computer stack, including firmware testing for hardware. I've also become proficient in prompt engineering, using tools like Perplexity.ai for research, Claude Code for software development, and ChatGPT for various tasks.

Some of the projects I've undertaken include developing my personal portfolio website (samkirk.com) with AI-powered hiring manager tools, creating an AI-powered photo transformation app called "Photo Fun," and building a website for a resort in Bali. I've also been exploring advanced AI techniques and developing educational demos like "Tensor Logic" to bridge neural and symbolic AI.
