**Sam Kirk:** *(8:53:24 AM)*

I have experience with a variety of programming languages acquired over 45+ years in Silicon Valley. My primary languages include Python (8+ years), TypeScript (4+ years), and C (15+ years). I also have experience with Rust (1+ year) for backend development, C++ (2 years) for hi-speed timing calibration, and assembly languages (5+ years) for various processors.

In recent years, I've focused on modern web development using TypeScript, React, and Next.js, along with Rust for backend services. I also have extensive experience using Python for test automation, data visualization, and scripting. My C experience spans various domains, including embedded systems, hardware testing, and audio processing.

Tell me about your most recent role.

**Sam Kirk:** *(8:53:24 AM)*

Currently, I am working as Chief Consulting Engineer at Samuel A. Kirk Consulting, which I started in March 2022. My focus is on AI-assisted software development and applying genAI to testing and documentation.

I've been deeply involved in full-stack development using tools like Cursor and Claude Code, building products that solve real problems. A significant part of my work involves a self-study, graduate-level course on genAI applied to software development, with an emphasis on testing and documentation. I've also become proficient in prompt engineering, using tools like Perplexity.ai, Claude Code, and ChatGPT to enhance my development process.
