**Sam Kirk:** *(7:57:11 PM)*

In my most recent role as a Senior Software Engineer at Tech Company (2020-Present), I led the development of AI-powered features for enterprise customers. This involved working across the full stack, from building React frontends to developing Python ML pipelines.

One of my key accomplishments was architecting and building a RAG-based document search system using LangChain and vector databases. This significantly reduced customer support response times by 40%. I also designed scalable data pipelines that processed millions of records daily with 99.9% uptime. In addition to development work, I mentored 5 junior engineers through code reviews, pair programming, and technical design sessions. Finally, I implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, which reduced deployment time from hours to minutes.
