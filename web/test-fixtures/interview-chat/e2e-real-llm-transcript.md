Tell me about your most recent role.

**Sam Kirk:** *(4:59:10 PM)*

In my most recent role as a Senior Software Engineer at Tech Company (2020-Present), I led the development of AI-powered features for enterprise customers. This involved working across the full stack, from building React frontends to developing Python ML pipelines.

A key accomplishment was architecting and building a RAG-based document search system using LangChain and vector databases. This significantly reduced customer support response times, by about 40%. I also designed scalable data pipelines that process millions of records daily with 99.9% uptime. Beyond development, I mentored junior engineers, implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and helped to reduce deployment time.
