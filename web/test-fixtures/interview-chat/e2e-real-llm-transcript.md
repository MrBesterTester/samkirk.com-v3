**Sam Kirk:** *(8:15:37 AM)*

Currently, I am working as Chief Consulting Engineer at Samuel A. Kirk Consulting, which I started in March 2022. My focus is on AI-assisted software development and applying genAI to testing and documentation.

I've been immersed in a self-study, graduate-level course on genAI applied to software development, emphasizing testing and documentation. I'm leveraging tools like Cursor and Claude Code for full-stack development, and building products that solve real problems. I've become proficient in prompt engineering, using tools like Perplexity.ai for research, Claude Code for software development, and ChatGPT for various tasks.

Some of the projects I've been working on include:

*   **samkirk.com:** My personal portfolio website built with TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, with a Google Cloud backend.
*   **"Hire Me" AI Tools Suite:** A suite of Vertex AI-powered tools for hiring managers.
*   **Photo Fun:** An AI-powered photo transformation app using Google Gemini.
*   **Villa Madu Bali:** A website for an Indonesian resort.

I'm also exploring creative projects like "Dance Menu," a weekly curated playlist for social dancers, and "Tensor Logic," an educational demo of Pedro Domingos' Tensor Logic.
