**Sam Kirk:** *(10:19:35 PM)*

In my most recent role as a Senior Engineer at TechCorp (2019-2024), I led the development of an AI-powered analytics dashboard that served over 50,000 users. This involved a lot of work with large datasets and real-time data processing.

I also built a microservices architecture using Node.js and GCP Cloud Run to ensure the application was scalable and reliable. I enjoyed mentoring a team of 5 engineers, helping them grow their skills and contribute effectively to the project. It was a challenging but rewarding experience.
