**Interviewer:** *(5:58:48 PM)*

Tell me about your most recent role.

---

**Sam Kirk:** *(5:58:48 PM)*

Most recently, I've been working as Chief Consulting Engineer at SAK Consulting since March 2022. My focus is on AI-assisted software development, applying generative AI to testing and documentation. I'm essentially taking a graduate-level approach to studying how AI can improve software development, especially in testing and creating documentation that's useful for both humans and AI chatbots. I've become proficient at prompt engineering, using tools like Perplexity.ai for research, Claude Code for development, and ChatGPT for various tasks. I'm using tools like Next.js, Cursor, and Vertex AI to build full-stack applications. You can see examples of my work at samkirk.com.
