However, the role emphasizes TypeScript and React/Node.js which are not primary strengths, though some JavaScript/TypeScript exposure through Next.js at SAK Consulting."

  "unknowns": [
    "Depth of TypeScript/React/Node.js experience - resume shows Python and C as primary languages",
    "Experience with containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) not explicitly mentioned",

  ],
  "recommendation": "Strong overall fit for the Senior Software Engineer position. The candidate's extensive experience (45+ years), active AI/ML development with Vertex AI and Gemini, and GCP cloud platform knowledge align well with the role. The main gap is around TypeScript/React/Node.js as primary skills, though the candidate has Next.js experience. Deep systems engineering background and current GenAI focus make this a compelling candidate. Recommend proceeding with interview to assess modern web stack depth."
