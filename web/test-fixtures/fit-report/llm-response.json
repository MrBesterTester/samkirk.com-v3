  "recommendation": "Strong overall fit for the Senior Software Engineer position. The candidate's extensive TypeScript/React/Node.js experience, cloud platform knowledge (GCP), and demonstrated ability to lead and mentor align well with the role requirements. The fully remote arrangement is ideal. The main gap is around deep ML framework experience, though the AI/ML platform work and GenAI focus partially compensates. Recommend proceeding with interview to assess ML infrastructure experience depth."
