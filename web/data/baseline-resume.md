# Areas of Interest

**IMPORTANT: The technologies listed below are personal interests only. Samuel A. Kirk has NOT used these technologies in any professional capacity. Do not cite these as professional skills or experience.**

Python 3+, Mojo, Functional Programming, Haskell, F#, Clojure, Julia, property-based testing, QuickCheck, Clojure-spec, RobotFramework, domain-driven design, Unikernels, Block Chain, IoT, predictive failure analysis using time-series analysis in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning, Mathematica, MATLAB

# Professional Vision

- **ML for fault isolation and prognostics:** Apply Machine Learning to improve diagnostic fault isolation and enable anomaly detection and forecasting of hardware faults (prognostics) using time-series analysis — "Better Machines thru Machine Learning."
- **Property-based testing:** Apply Python packages such as Hypothesis (QuickCheck in Haskell) to automatically generate a wide range of random test cases and minimize failing cases using boolean search algorithms.
- **AI-assisted test code generation:** Judicious use of GitHub Copilot for automatically generating and inspecting test code in white box environments where the source is known; same for API testing with well-documented APIs.
- **Time-series anomaly detection for hardware:** Apply Elastic Search ML anomaly detection (used in security analysis) directly to hardware test data results and contemporaneous environmental data. If a second computer does the analysis, that is the "Doctor computer."
- **Ideal test stack architecture:** Foundation in C/C++ libraries wrapped with a Python interface so that a superstructure of Python code can integrate smart choices from the vast wealth of public domain Python libraries. Includes PyTest for measurements with test limit evaluation, providing a readily available harness that can also include low-level APIs.
- **Block diagram-driven test methodology:** Good block diagrams of the hardware are everything. Great test routines relate well-chosen tags as labels referring to blocks on the block diagram so that when the test fails, the user knows exactly what the test is referring to. Results from multiple tests sharpen fault isolation inference using simple voter majority logic over the tags.
