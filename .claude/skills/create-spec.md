## Prompt

```
@docs/Dylan-Davis-50plus-method.md

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea.

Remember, only one question at a time.

At any point during our conversation, I may provide prior work, examples, API documentation, or other reference materials. When I do, incorporate them into your understanding and adjust your questions accordingly.

When done at the end of our dialog, please write out the specification as @docs/SPECIFICATION.md.
