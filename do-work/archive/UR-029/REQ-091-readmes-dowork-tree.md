# Add READMEs for do-work/ tree

## What
Create README.md files for the four do-work folders that currently lack them:
- `do-work/` (root) — the autonomous work queue system
- `do-work/archive/` — completed and on-hold REQs
- `do-work/user-requests/` — incoming UR folders with verbatim input
- `do-work/working/` — currently processing REQs

## Context
The project has READMEs in 9 key folders (root, .claude/, docs/, web/, web/e2e/fixtures/, web/test-fixtures/ and its three sub-fixtures). The do-work system is central to the project's autonomous workflow but has no READMEs explaining the folder structure, file naming conventions, or lifecycle.

## Detailed Requirements
- Each README should explain the folder's purpose, what files live there, and how they flow through the system
- Reference the do-work skill documentation (`.claude/skills/do-work/`) for accurate descriptions
- Follow the style of existing READMEs in the project (concise, practical, not over-documented)
- The root `do-work/README.md` should explain the overall queue system and link to subfolders
- Keep READMEs short — these are orientation guides, not full documentation

## Builder Guidance
- Certainty level: Firm on which folders need READMEs; flexible on exact content
- Scope cues: Keep it simple — short, useful orientation docs

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear deliverables (4 READMEs) but need to explore existing README style and do-work folder contents to match conventions.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Clear feature request with well-defined folders. Just need to discover existing README style to match.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- Existing READMEs range 24-338 lines; focused subfolder READMEs are 24-70 lines
- Style: practical, direct — title + purpose sentence, structure diagram, brief explanations, cross-references
- web/README.md (48 lines) is a good model: tree diagram, key directories, further reading links
- do-work/archive/ contains 28 UR folders plus hold/, legacy/, test-runs/
- do-work/user-requests/ contains active UR-029
- do-work/working/ is transient (single REQ at a time)

## Implementation Summary

Created 4 README.md files:

- `do-work/README.md` (44 lines) — queue system overview, lifecycle diagram, folder structure, key commands, further reading
- `do-work/archive/README.md` (36 lines) — UR folder structure, what's in a completed REQ, archival rules
- `do-work/user-requests/README.md` (32 lines) — UR structure, input.md format example, lifecycle steps
- `do-work/working/README.md` (20 lines) — rules, status flow diagram

All follow the concise, practical style of existing project READMEs.

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** N/A
**Result:** Documentation-only change — no code modified, no tests needed.

*Verified by work action*
