# Add READMEs for standalone folders

## What
Create README.md files for five standalone folders that currently lack them:
- `.cursor/` — Cursor IDE commands and rules
- `REFERENCES/` — methodology study guides (Dylan Davis, Matt Maher)
- `web/data/` — resume data files
- `web/e2e/` — Playwright E2E tests (note: `web/e2e/fixtures/` already has a README)
- `web/scripts/` — build and test scripts

## Context
These folders serve distinct purposes and aren't part of a larger tree. REFERENCES/ contains the two HTML study guides that are central to the project methodology. .cursor/ has IDE-specific commands/rules. web/scripts/ has build tooling.

## Detailed Requirements
- Each README should explain the folder's purpose and list key contents
- `.cursor/` should explain the commands and rules structure, and note the `.claude/CURSOR-COMPATIBILITY.md` mapping
- `REFERENCES/` should briefly describe each study guide and its methodology
- `web/data/` should explain what resume data lives here and how it's used
- `web/e2e/` should explain the E2E test setup and how to run tests (don't duplicate the fixtures README)
- `web/scripts/` should list the available scripts and their purposes
- Follow existing README style — concise and practical

## Builder Guidance
- Certainty level: Firm on which folders; flexible on content
- Scope cues: Keep them brief — orientation-level docs

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear deliverables (5 READMEs for standalone folders) but need to explore actual folder contents for accuracy.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Well-defined folder list with clear requirements. Need to discover actual contents to write accurate descriptions.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- .cursor/ has 5 commands (create-spec/blueprint/todo, start/continue-step) and 3 rules (project, phase-model-reminder, workflow-setup)
- .claude/CURSOR-COMPATIBILITY.md exists for cross-tool mapping
- REFERENCES/ has 2 HTML study guides: Dylan Davis 50+ method (57 KB) and Matt Maher Claude Code (51 KB)
- web/data/ has baseline-resume.md (30 KB) — master resume used by LLM tools
- web/e2e/ has 5 test specs, playwright.config.ts, zip-verify.ts helper, and fixtures/ (already has README)
- web/scripts/ has 6 scripts: test-all, test-results, e2e-real-llm, smoke-gcp, seed-resume, validate-resume

## Implementation Summary

Created 5 README.md files:

- `.cursor/README.md` (24 lines) — commands table, rules list, Claude Code compatibility link
- `REFERENCES/README.md` (13 lines) — study guide descriptions and usage note
- `web/data/README.md` (15 lines) — resume file purpose and seeding workflow
- `web/e2e/README.md` (30 lines) — test spec table, helpers, run commands, config notes
- `web/scripts/README.md` (24 lines) — scripts table with commands and key flags

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** N/A
**Result:** Documentation-only change — no code modified, no tests needed.

*Verified by work action*
