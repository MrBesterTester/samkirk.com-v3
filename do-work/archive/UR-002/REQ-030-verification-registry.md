# Create verification registry (Step 6.3)

## What
Create `docs/verification-registry.md` documenting the manual verification procedures (VER-001 through VER-003) with full metadata per SPECIFICATION section 5.3.

## Checklist
- [x] Create `docs/verification-registry.md`
- [x] Document VER-001: Visual inspect resume PDF layout
- [x] Document VER-002: OAuth flow in fresh browser session
- [x] Document VER-003: Cloud Run deployment serves traffic
- [x] TEST: Runner `--release` output references registry entries

## Blueprint Guidance
- **Goal**: Create `docs/verification-registry.md` for manual verification procedures
- **File to create**: `docs/verification-registry.md`
- **Implementation**:
  - Document initial verifications: VER-001 (PDF layout), VER-002 (OAuth flow), VER-003 (Cloud Run deployment)
  - Use the metadata format from SPECIFICATION section 5.3 (verification variant)
  - Include step-by-step procedures for each
- **Test plan**: The master test runner's `--release` output references these entries

## Context
- **Document set**: master-test
- **Phase**: 6 — Documentation
- **Specification**: See docs/master-test-SPECIFICATION.md Section 5.3 (verification metadata fields)
- **Model recommendation**: Codex/Opus (advisory — use if your tool supports model selection)

## Dependencies
Can be done in parallel with other Phase 6 steps. The runner (Phase 2-3) should reference these entries in `--release` output.

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear deliverable (verification registry document) with defined format (Section 5.3), but need to explore the specification for the metadata format and the test runner for `--release` output references.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Clear document creation task with defined format. Just need to discover Section 5.3 metadata format and how the runner references verifications.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- **Section 5.3 metadata fields**: ID, Headline, Description, Type (Verification/manual), Features covered, Procedure (step-by-step), Inputs (what verifier needs), Expected outputs (what passing looks like), GCP required (Yes/No).
- **Runner `--release` output** (`web/scripts/test-all.ts` lines 867-873): Hardcodes checklist in archived summary.md: `- [x] VER-001: Visual inspect resume PDF layout`, `- [x] VER-002: OAuth flow in fresh browser session`, `- [x] VER-003: Cloud Run deployment serves traffic`.
- **Feature-test matrix GAP-004**: Deployment coverage note suggests VER-001 through VER-003 for domain serving, www redirect, Cloud Run health.
- **VER-001 context** (SPEC 8.2): Resume tool outputs markdown + rendered HTML, 2-page constraint, need visual inspection for layout/page breaks.
- **VER-002 context** (SPEC 9): Google OAuth restricted to sam@samkirk.com, admin functions (resume upload, dance menu upload, submissions).
- **VER-003 context** (SPEC 6): samkirk.com canonical, www redirect, Cloud Run deployment, DNS in Microsoft DNS.

## Implementation Summary

- Created `docs/verification-registry.md` (78 lines)
- Summary table with 3 VER entries (VER-001, VER-002, VER-003)
- Detailed entries with full Section 5.3 metadata: ID, Headline, Description, Type, Features, Procedure, Inputs, Expected outputs, GCP required
- Cross-references section linking to test-catalog.md, feature-test-matrix.md, test-all.ts, and master-test-SPECIFICATION.md

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** Verified VER IDs match runner's --release checklist
**Result:** All 3 VER IDs (VER-001, VER-002, VER-003) match exactly between `web/scripts/test-all.ts` lines 867-873 and `docs/verification-registry.md`

**Verified:**
- Runner --release output references all 3 registry entries with matching headlines
- All Section 5.3 metadata fields present for each entry
- Cross-references link to all related documents
