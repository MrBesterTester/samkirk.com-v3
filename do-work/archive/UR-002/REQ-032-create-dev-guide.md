# Create Developer Guide (Step 7.2)

## What
Create `README_dev_guide.md` at the project root as a standalone reference document for day-to-day test workflows, distilled from BLUEPRINT Phase 7 sections 7.1-7.8.

## Checklist
- [x] Create `README_dev_guide.md` at project root
- [x] Write do-work test workflows (new test, fix/rewrite, triage)
- [x] Write manual verification procedures
- [x] Write test running commands (release vs debugging)
- [x] Write suite reference table and conventions
- [x] Write manual fallback section (`start step` / `continue step`)
- [x] TEST: All commands in guide match implemented test runner

## Blueprint Guidance
- **Goal**: Create a standalone developer guide at the project root that consolidates the day-to-day test workflows from the blueprint into a reference document
- **File to create**: `README_dev_guide.md` (project root)
- **Content** (distilled from BLUEPRINT sections 7.1-7.8):
  - How do-work handles test work (pipeline overview)
  - Writing a new test (do-work commands + conventions + suite reference table)
  - Fixing or rewriting an existing test (with guiding principles reference)
  - Triage workflows
  - Performing a manual verification (release checklist + failure handling)
  - Running tests (release vs debugging commands)
  - Planned test work from a TODO cycle
  - Manual fallback (`start step` / `continue step`)
- **Key difference from BLUEPRINT Phase 7**: The dev guide is a **reference document** for daily use, not an implementation plan. Written in second-person ("To write a new test, run..."), assumes no context on the Dylan Davis methodology.

## Context
- **Document set**: master-test
- **Phase**: 7 — Developer Workflow
- **Specification**: See docs/master-test-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Opus 4.5 (advisory — use if your tool supports model selection)

## Dependencies
Depends on Phases 1-6 being complete so the guide accurately reflects the implemented system.

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear deliverable (developer guide document), but need to explore BLUEPRINT Phase 7 for content and the test runner for accurate commands.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Clear document creation task distilling BLUEPRINT Phase 7. Just need to discover the source content and actual test runner commands.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- **BLUEPRINT Phase 7** (sections 7.1-7.8): Covers do-work pipeline overview, writing new tests, fixing/rewriting tests, triage workflows, manual verifications, running tests (release vs debug), planned test work from TODO cycle, manual fallback.
- **Test runner CLI** (`test-all.ts`): Flags: `--unit`, `--e2e`, `--e2e-real`, `--smoke`, `--no-gcp`, `--gcp`, `--interactive`, `--verbose`, `--release`, `--ref`, `--no-archive`. Release mode requires GCP, runs all suites, prints manual verification checklist.
- **package.json scripts**: `test` (vitest), `test:e2e` (playwright), `test:e2e:ui`, `test:e2e:real`, `test:all` (master runner), `smoke:gcp`, `seed:resume`, `validate:resume`.
- **File conventions**: Unit=`*.test.ts` (Vitest), E2E=`*.spec.ts` (Playwright), Scripts=`web/scripts/*.ts`.
- **Verification registry**: 3 VER entries (PDF layout, OAuth flow, Cloud Run deployment). Hardcoded in test-all.ts --release output.
- **Manual fallback**: `start step X.Y master-test` / `continue step X.Y master-test` — reads all 3 companion docs.
- **Archive structure**: `do-work/archive/test-runs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/` with `summary.md` (committed) and `*.log` (gitignored).

## Implementation Summary

- Created `README_dev_guide.md` at project root (283 lines)
- 12 sections distilled from BLUEPRINT Phase 7 (7.1-7.8):
  - Test Suites at a Glance (reference table)
  - Running Tests (full, individual, GCP control, debugging)
  - Release Qualification (--release workflow)
  - Writing a New Test (do-work workflow + conventions)
  - Fixing or Rewriting a Test
  - Triage Workflows (ad-hoc + formalized)
  - Manual Verifications (VER-001 through VER-003)
  - Planned Test Work (TODO cycle)
  - Manual Fallback (start step / continue step)
  - Conventions (naming, data policy, TypeScript)
  - Reference Documents (5 linked docs)
- Written in second-person, standalone reference (no Dylan Davis methodology assumed)

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** Cross-referenced all commands against `web/package.json` scripts
**Result:** All commands match implemented scripts

**Verified:**
- `npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run test:e2e:real`, `npm run smoke:gcp`, `npm run test:all`, `npm run test:e2e:ui` all match package.json
- `--unit`, `--e2e`, `--e2e-real`, `--smoke`, `--no-gcp`, `--gcp`, `--verbose`, `--release`, `--ref`, `--no-archive` all match test-all.ts CLI flags
