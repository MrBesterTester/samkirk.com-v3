## Request

Redesign the home page layout to read like a concise, annotated table of contents. Each section (except "Hiring Manager?") should have:

1. One title
2. A nice annotation (short description)
3. One link

The "Hiring Manager?" section keeps its current format. All other sections should be simplified — remove verbose cards, previews, and multi-element layouts in favor of a clean, scannable list.

## Constraints

- Keep the "Hiring Manager?" section as-is
- Each other section: title + annotation + link only
- Maintain existing routing/URLs

---

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear UI redesign with well-defined outcome (TOC-style layout), but need to explore the current home page structure, component patterns, and routing to understand what to simplify.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Clear feature request — simplify home page sections to title + annotation + link. Just need to discover the current layout structure and components to know what to change.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- Home page: `web/src/app/page.tsx` (295 lines)
- Sections to simplify: Dance Menu (lines 82-99), Photo Fun (101-130), Song Dedication (132-252), Explore More (254-279)
- "Hiring Manager?" section (lines 39-80): keep as-is per request
- Hero section (lines 8-37): keep as-is (not a navigable section)
- Contact CTA (lines 281-292): keep as-is (simple email link)
- ToolPreview component used for Dance Menu card — will be removed in favor of simple title+annotation+link
- Photo Fun uses a custom card with external link to `https://photo-fun.samkirk.com`
- Song Dedication has a large card with audio player, lyrics, etc. — links to `/song-dedication`
- Explore More has 3 pill-style links to `/explorations`, `/dance-menu`, `/song-dedication`
- Styling pattern for links: `text-accent hover:text-accent-hover` with `font-medium`
- Section headings: `text-2xl font-semibold text-text-primary` centered
- Annotation text: `text-text-secondary` centered

## Implementation Summary

- Replaced 4 verbose sections (Dance Menu card, Photo Fun card, Song Dedication card with audio/lyrics, Explore More pills) with a clean TOC-style list
- Each TOC entry: heading + one-line annotation + action link (title + annotation + link pattern)
- TOC entries: Dance Menu → `/dance-menu`, Photo Fun → `https://photo-fun.samkirk.com`, Song Dedication → `/song-dedication`, Explorations → `/explorations`
- Hero, Hiring Manager, and Contact CTA sections kept untouched
- Page reduced from 295 lines to 162 lines
- Updated `page.test.tsx` to match new TOC structure (test for headings + link hrefs per section)

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** `npx vitest run src/app/page.test.tsx`
**Result:** All 5 tests passing

**Updated tests:**
- `web/src/app/page.test.tsx` — replaced "renders the explore section with navigation links" with "renders TOC sections with links to each page" covering all 4 TOC entries

**Build verified:** `npx next build` — successful, no errors
