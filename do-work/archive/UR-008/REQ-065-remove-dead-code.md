# Remove dead code (Step 4.2)

## What
Clean up unused imports, components, and orphaned files from the old tool pages now that they've been replaced with redirects.

## Checklist
- [x] Remove unused imports and components from old pages
- [x] Clean up any orphaned component files specific to old pages

## Blueprint Guidance
Remove dead code from old pages. After replacing with redirects, the old page-specific components (FitToolContent, ResumeToolContent, InterviewToolContent, and their sub-components) may be orphaned if not imported elsewhere.

Scan for:
- Components only imported by old hire-me tool pages
- Utility functions only used by those components
- Types only referenced by those components

Do NOT remove:
- API route handlers (`/api/tools/fit/*`, `/api/tools/resume`, `/api/tools/interview`)
- `ToolGate.tsx` (still used)
- `JobInputForm` (may still be referenced by JobContextBar or other code)
- Shared types used by the new components

## Context
- **Document set**: hire-me-unified
- **Phase**: 4 — Redirects + Cleanup
- **Specification**: See docs/hire-me-unified-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Sonnet 4 (advisory — quick fix)

## Dependencies
Depends on Step 4.1 (redirects in place) and Phase 3 (unified page using new components).

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Need to explore which files are actually orphaned before removing anything. Can't know scope without scanning imports.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Need to discover orphaned files through import analysis, then selectively remove them.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

Thorough scan of the codebase found:

- All old page-specific components (FitToolContent, ResumeToolContent, InterviewToolContent, ScoreBadge, JobInputForm, FollowUpQuestion, Results, ChatMessageBubble, WelcomeMessage, TypingIndicator, etc.) were **inline** within the old page files — not separate component files
- Since REQ-064 already replaced those pages with redirect stubs, all inline dead code was already removed
- No separate orphaned component files, utility files, or type files were found
- API routes, ToolGate, lib files, and new `components/hire-me/` components are all still in use

**Conclusion:** No dead code to remove — the old inline components were already deleted when the pages were replaced with redirects.

*Generated by Explore agent*

## Implementation Summary

- No code changes needed — exploration confirmed all dead code was already removed in REQ-064 when the old pages (which contained all their components inline) were replaced with redirect stubs

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** N/A — no code changes made
**Result:** Suite already verified in REQ-064

*Verified by work action*
