# Rich Card Components (Step 1.5)

## What
Build the three rich chat card components that render inline in the chat stream: FitReportCard (scores + categories), ResumePreviewCard (header + stats + download), and FitQuestionCard (interactive follow-up questions with read-only state after answering).

## Checklist
- [x] Build `FitReportCard.tsx` — overall score, categories, recommendation, download button
- [x] Build `ResumePreviewCard.tsx` — header, summary, stats grid, download button
- [x] Build `FitQuestionCard.tsx` — question text, options/textarea, submit, progress indicator
- [x] FitQuestionCard: disabled state after answered (shows selected answer)

## Blueprint Guidance
**`FitReportCard.tsx`** — Rich chat card for fit results
- Overall score badge, category breakdown, recommendation, unknowns
- Download button inline
- Adapted from current `Results` component in fit/page.tsx

**`ResumePreviewCard.tsx`** — Rich chat card for resume results
- Header, summary, stats grid
- Download button inline
- Adapted from current `ResumePreview` + `Results` in resume/page.tsx

**`FitQuestionCard.tsx`** — Interactive chat card for fit follow-ups
- Question text, radio options or textarea, submit button
- Progress indicator ("Question 2 of 5")
- Adapted from current `FollowUpQuestion` component
- Disabled after answered (shows selected answer)

## Context
- **Document set**: hire-me-unified
- **Phase**: 1 — Extract Shared Components
- **Specification**: See docs/hire-me-unified-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Opus 4.5 (advisory)

## Dependencies
Depends on Step 1.1 (directory creation). Adapt from existing fit and resume page components. ChatStream (Step 1.4) will import these.

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Three well-defined card components with clear specs. Need to explore existing fit/resume page components to adapt patterns from.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Each card component has clear spec (score badge, stats grid, question options). Just need to discover existing patterns from fit/page.tsx and resume/page.tsx to adapt.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- fit/page.tsx: ScoreBadge (green/yellow/red badges), FollowUpQuestion (progress, radio/textarea, required badge), Results (overall score, recommendation, categories, unknowns, download)
- resume/page.tsx: ResumePreview (header/title/email/location, summary, 3-col stats grid), Results (download with blob pattern)
- ChatStream.tsx placeholder types were minimal; needed expansion for full data
- Download pattern: fetch blob from `/api/submissions/${submissionId}/download`, create anchor, trigger download
- Card styling: `rounded-xl border border-zinc-200 bg-white dark:border-zinc-700 dark:bg-zinc-800/50`

## Implementation Summary

- Created `web/src/components/hire-me/FitReportCard.tsx` — overall score badge, job context, recommendation, category breakdown with ScoreBadge, unknowns amber box, download button
- Created `web/src/components/hire-me/ResumePreviewCard.tsx` — header card, summary, 3-column stats grid (experience/skills/pages), download button
- Created `web/src/components/hire-me/FitQuestionCard.tsx` — interactive mode (progress, required badge, radio options or textarea, submit) + answered read-only mode
- Updated `web/src/components/hire-me/ChatStream.tsx` — expanded FitReportMessage, ResumePreviewMessage, FitQuestionMessage types with full data fields; replaced placeholder renderers with card components; added onAnswer and answeredQuestions to ChatStreamProps
- Updated `web/src/components/hire-me/index.ts` — barrel exports for 3 new components and their prop types

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx vitest run`
**Result:** TypeScript compiles cleanly (only pre-existing test file errors). All 1232 unit tests passing (38 test files).

**New tests added:** None — UI card components adapted from existing page-level components. Will be covered by E2E tests when the unified page is assembled.
