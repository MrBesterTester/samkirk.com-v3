# Add READMEs for web/src/ tree

## What
Create README.md files for the five web/src folders that currently lack them:
- `web/src/` — source root
- `web/src/app/` — Next.js App Router pages and API routes
- `web/src/components/` — shared React components
- `web/src/lib/` — core business logic (40+ modules)
- `web/src/test/` — test utilities

## Context
The web/src/lib/ folder is the most complex folder in the project with 40+ modules of core business logic. web/src/app/ contains all pages and API routes. Neither has any orientation documentation. The existing web/README.md covers the application at a high level but doesn't detail the source tree.

## Detailed Requirements
- Each README should explain the folder's purpose, key files/subfolders, and conventions
- `web/src/lib/` is highest value — should list or categorize the major modules
- `web/src/app/` should explain the routing structure and API route conventions
- `web/src/components/` should note any component organization patterns
- `web/src/test/` should explain available test utilities and how they're used
- Follow the project's existing README style (concise, practical)

## Builder Guidance
- Certainty level: Firm on which folders; flexible on depth
- Scope cues: web/src/lib/ deserves the most detail; others can be brief
- The builder should explore the actual folder contents to write accurate descriptions

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear deliverables (5 READMEs) but need to explore actual folder contents to write accurate descriptions, especially web/src/lib/ with 50+ modules.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Well-defined folder list. Need to discover actual file contents and patterns to write accurate READMEs.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- web/src/ contains app/, components/, hooks/, lib/, test/, and proxy.ts
- web/src/app/ has 12 page routes, 15+ API routes, admin routes with NextAuth protection
- web/src/components/ has 8 shared components + 6 hire-me domain components, co-located tests
- web/src/lib/ has 53 files across 10 categories: LLM, job analysis, resume processing, storage, database, auth, security, cost, retention, config
- web/src/test/ has 2 files: Vitest setup (DOM matchers, server-only mock, cleanup) and TypeScript declarations
- All lib/ modules use `import "server-only"`; tests are co-located throughout

## Implementation Summary

Created 5 README.md files:

- `web/src/README.md` (19 lines) — source root structure and conventions
- `web/src/app/README.md` (56 lines) — pages, admin routes, API routes, conventions
- `web/src/components/README.md` (32 lines) — component tree with descriptions
- `web/src/lib/README.md` (68 lines) — all 50+ modules categorized by purpose (highest detail)
- `web/src/test/README.md` (19 lines) — setup file explanation and test commands

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** N/A
**Result:** Documentation-only change — no code modified, no tests needed.

*Verified by work action*
