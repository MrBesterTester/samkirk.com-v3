# Fix cluttered Hire Me chat interface

## Full Verbatim Input

The Hire Me page output is very cluttered. There is a warning box with a message about "Ask about..." with a warning symbol on it — is that necessary? Perhaps it should be nailed at the top of the discussion. Most importantly, it seems to be requiring a new text box for every request. The input placeholder area looks like a warning box. The "Analyze My Fit" / "Generate Resume" preset buttons and the actions bar (download buttons + New Conversation) wedged between chat messages and input create visual noise.
