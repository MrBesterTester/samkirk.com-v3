# ChatInput (Step 1.3)

## What
Build the bottom input area with an auto-resizing textarea, send button, and preset action chips ("Analyze My Fit", "Generate Resume") that appear above the input when a job is loaded.

## Checklist
- [x] Build `ChatInput.tsx` with auto-resizing textarea + send button
- [x] Add preset chips row ("Analyze My Fit", "Generate Resume") above input
- [x] Chips visible only when job loaded and no flow active
- [x] Disabled state during loading
- [x] Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline

## Blueprint Guidance
**`ChatInput.tsx`** — Bottom input area
- Auto-resizing textarea + send button (reuse existing pattern)
- Preset chips row above input (visible when job loaded and no flow active)
- Disabled during active loading

## Context
- **Document set**: hire-me-unified
- **Phase**: 1 — Extract Shared Components
- **Specification**: See docs/hire-me-unified-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Opus 4.5 (advisory)

## Dependencies
Depends on Step 1.1 (directory creation). Adapt from interview page's existing ChatInput pattern.

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear feature but need to find existing chat input patterns from interview page to reuse.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Well-defined component with clear props/behavior. Need to discover existing chat input pattern to match.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- Interview page at `web/src/app/hire-me/interview/page.tsx` has inline ChatInput with auto-resizing textarea
- Uses `rounded-xl border border-zinc-300` textarea styling with dark mode variants
- Send button: `rounded-xl bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 dark:bg-blue-500`
- Enter/Shift+Enter handling via `onKeyDown`
- Auto-resize via ref and scrollHeight adjustment

*Generated by Explore agent*

## Implementation Summary

- Created `web/src/components/hire-me/ChatInput.tsx` with auto-resizing textarea, send button, and preset chips
- Props: `onSend`, `onPreset`, `isLoading`, `jobLoaded`, `flowActive`, `disabled`
- Preset chips ("Analyze My Fit", "Generate Resume") with SVG icons, visible only when `jobLoaded && !flowActive`
- Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline
- Exported `ChatInput` and `ChatInputProps` from barrel `index.ts`

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
**Result:** Zero new errors — all errors are pre-existing in unrelated test files

UI component will be covered by E2E tests in REQ-066.

*Verified by work action*
