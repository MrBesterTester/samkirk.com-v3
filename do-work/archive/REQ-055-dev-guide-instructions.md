# Create dev guide instructions (Step 4.2)

## What
Update `README_dev_guide.md` to replace manual archive inspection commands with a proper usage guide for `npm run test:results`, including examples for each flag and common workflows.

## Checklist
- [x] Replace "Viewing Previous Results" section with a usage guide for `npm run test:results`
- [x] Include examples for each flag with expected output descriptions
- [x] Document common workflows: "check latest results", "compare runs", "debug a suite failure", "see what fixtures changed"
- [x] Keep Playwright HTML report and `.last-run.json` lines as-is (they serve a different purpose)
- [x] Update Test Fixtures section to explain that fixture updates now appear automatically in test run summaries

## Blueprint Guidance

### 4. Modify: `README_dev_guide.md` — create user-level instructions

Replace the "Viewing Previous Results" section with a proper usage guide for `npm run test:results`. The current section has raw `ls -t` + `cat` commands — replace with:

**Command reference** with examples for each flag:
```bash
npm run test:results                         # Latest run summary + fixture updates
npm run test:results -- --list               # All archived runs
npm run test:results -- --full               # Latest with test index
npm run test:results -- --log e2e-tests      # Raw E2E log output
npm run test:results -- --fixtures           # Fixture inventory
npm run test:results -- --diff               # Compare last two runs
npm run test:results -- --json               # Machine-readable JSON output
```

**Common workflows** section showing task-oriented recipes:
- "Check latest results" → `npm run test:results`
- "Compare runs after a fix" → `npm run test:results -- --diff`
- "Debug a suite failure" → `npm run test:results -- --log <suite>`
- "See what fixtures changed" → `npm run test:results -- --fixtures`

Keep the Playwright HTML report and `.last-run.json` lines as-is (they serve a different purpose).

Update the Test Fixtures section to explain that fixture updates now appear automatically in test run summaries, linking the fixtures back to the tests that generated them.

## Context
- **Document set**: test-results
- **Phase**: 4 — Registration and Documentation
- **Blueprint**: See docs/test-results-BLUEPRINT.md for full design
- **Model recommendation**: Sonnet 4 (advisory — use if your tool supports model selection)

## Dependencies
Depends on all Phase 1-3 steps being complete so the documentation reflects the actual implemented feature.

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear documentation update with well-specified content from the blueprint, but need to find the existing "Viewing Previous Results" section and understand the current structure of README_dev_guide.md to make the replacement cleanly.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: The blueprint provides exact content and structure for the documentation update. Just need to find the existing sections to replace.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- Found "Viewing Previous Results" section at lines 157-177 with raw `ls -t` + `cat` commands
- Found "Test Fixtures" section at lines 179-187 with fixture table
- Playwright HTML report and `.last-run.json` lines identified for preservation
- `test:results` script at `web/scripts/test-results.ts` supports 8 flags: `--list`, `--run`, `--full`, `--log`, `--fixtures`, `--diff`, `--json`, and bare default

*Generated by Explore agent*

## Implementation Summary

- Replaced "Viewing Previous Results" section (lines 157-177) with structured `npm run test:results` usage guide including command reference code block, common workflows table, and "Other tools" subsection preserving Playwright commands
- Added fixture auto-reporting note to "Test Fixtures" section introductory paragraph

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** N/A
**Result:** Documentation-only change — no tests needed
