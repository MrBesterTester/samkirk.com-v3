# Separate Google Billing Accounts

## What
Examine the Google Cloud account structure for two projects — samkirk-v3 (this project) and photo-fun (../photo-fun3) — to determine whether they have separate billing accounts. If they share a billing account, create a plan to separate them so expenses can be tracked independently.

## Context
- Two GCP projects on the same Google account (sam@samkirk.com)
- samkirk-v3: this project
- photo-fun: located at ../photo-fun3
- Goal: independent expense tracking per project
- May require creating a second billing account and re-linking one project

## Assets
None
