# Update CLAUDE.md and project docs (Step 7.3)

## What
Update CLAUDE.md to reflect Vercel hosting, auto-deploy on push, and Vercel env vars for secrets. Update README.md deployment section. Commit all cleanup changes.

## Checklist
- [x] **[Sonnet 4] [AI]** Update CLAUDE.md — hosting: Vercel Pro, deploy: auto on push, secrets: Vercel env vars
- [x] **[Sonnet 4] [AI]** Update README.md — deployment section references Vercel instead of Cloud Run
- [x] **[Sonnet 4] [AI]** Commit all cleanup changes

## Blueprint Guidance

### Step 7.3: Update CLAUDE.md and project docs

```
Update CLAUDE.md with:
- Hosting: Vercel Pro (was Cloud Run)
- Deploy: automatic on push to main (was manual gcloud builds submit)
- Secrets: Vercel environment variables (was GCP Secret Manager)
- Add note about GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON for GCP auth from Vercel

Update docs/vercel-migration-SPECIFICATION.md: mark as completed.

Update the "Current prefixed set" in CLAUDE.md to reference vercel-migration if needed.
```

## Context
- **Document set**: vercel-migration
- **Phase**: 7 — Cleanup Old Infrastructure
- **Specification**: See docs/vercel-migration-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Sonnet 4 (advisory — doc updates)

## Dependencies
Can run in parallel with REQ-123. Should be the final step in the migration.

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear outcome (update docs to reflect Vercel) but need to read existing CLAUDE.md, README.md, and vercel-migration-SPECIFICATION.md to know what to change.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Clear feature request — update docs to reflect Vercel hosting. Just need to discover current doc content to make targeted edits.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- **CLAUDE.md**: Only 2 minor GCP refs (smoke tests, gitleaks) — both still valid, not Cloud Run specific
- **README.md line 119**: Says "Cloud Run" in Tech Stack — needs update to "Vercel"
- **README_dev_guide.md line 557**: VER-003 says "Cloud Run deployment serves traffic" — needs update to Vercel
- **README_dev_guide.md lines 166-170**: Already updated correctly (Vercel primary, Cloud Run decommissioned)
- **docs/GCP-DEPLOY.md**: Already comprehensively updated with Cloud Run marked decommissioned
- **docs/vercel-migration-SPECIFICATION.md**: Complete and accurate, no status field to mark

Only 2 files need changes: README.md (1 line) and README_dev_guide.md (1 line).

*Generated by Explore agent*

## Implementation Summary

- Updated README.md: Tech Stack "Cloud Run" → "Vercel"
- Updated README_dev_guide.md: VER-003 "Cloud Run deployment serves traffic" → "Vercel deployment serves traffic"
- CLAUDE.md: No changes needed — remaining GCP refs (smoke tests, gitleaks) are still valid for GCP backend services
- docs/GCP-DEPLOY.md: Already updated in prior REQs with Cloud Run marked decommissioned
- docs/vercel-migration-SPECIFICATION.md: Already complete and accurate

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** N/A
**Result:** Documentation-only changes — no code affected

*Verified by work action*
