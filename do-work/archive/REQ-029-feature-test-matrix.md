# Create feature-test matrix (Step 6.2)

## What
Create `docs/feature-test-matrix.md` mapping every feature from SPECIFICATION.md to its tests and/or verifications, identifying and documenting coverage gaps.

## Checklist
- [ ] Create `docs/feature-test-matrix.md`
- [ ] Extract features from `docs/SPECIFICATION.md`
- [ ] Map each feature to test(s) and/or verification(s)
- [ ] Identify and document coverage gaps
- [ ] TEST: No feature row is empty

## Blueprint Guidance
- **Goal**: Create `docs/feature-test-matrix.md` mapping features to tests
- **File to create**: `docs/feature-test-matrix.md`
- **Implementation**:
  - Extract features from `docs/SPECIFICATION.md`
  - Map each feature to its test(s) and/or verification(s) from the catalog
  - Identify coverage gaps (features with no tests)
  - Format per SPECIFICATION section 5.4 rules
- **Test plan**: No feature row is empty; every test appears in at least one feature row

## Context
- **Document set**: master-test
- **Phase**: 6 — Documentation
- **Specification**: See docs/master-test-SPECIFICATION.md Section 5.4 (Feature-Test Matrix)
- **Model recommendation**: Codex/Opus (advisory — use if your tool supports model selection)

## Dependencies
Depends on REQ-028 (Step 6.1) — the test catalog must exist to map features to tests.

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear deliverable (feature-test matrix document) with well-defined format, but need to explore the SPECIFICATION.md for features and the test catalog from REQ-028 for test mappings.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Clear feature with defined output format (Section 5.4). Just need to discover the features in SPECIFICATION.md and the test catalog output from REQ-028.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- **Section 5.4 rules** (master-test-SPECIFICATION.md): Every feature row must have at least one test OR verification; empty rows are gaps. Many-to-many mapping. "Coverage Notes" column required.
- **Features extracted** from SPECIFICATION.md sections 7-15: 13 feature areas (LLM Provider, Fit Tool, Resume Tool, Interview Tool, Citations, Dance Menu, Static Pages, Admin/Auth, Session Management, Rate Limiting, Spend Cap, CAPTCHA, Data Storage, Job URLs, Reliability, Technical Constraints, Deployment)
- **Test catalog** at `docs/test-catalog.md` (55 entries, 1,212 tests). Already includes a Feature Coverage Reference table (lines 230-248) mapping features to TEST-IDs.
- **Test files**: 25 unit test files in `web/src/lib/`, 4 E2E spec files in `web/e2e/`, plus custom scripts for real LLM E2E and GCP smoke tests.
- **Recent verifications**: REQ-025 (release mode), REQ-026/027 (test triage), REQ-028 (catalog) all completed successfully.

## Implementation Summary

- Created `docs/feature-test-matrix.md` (139 lines)
- Coverage Summary table: 16 feature rows mapping SPECIFICATION.md sections 7-15 to 55 test catalog entries
- Test-to-Feature Reverse Index: all 55 TEST-IDs mapped back to feature rows (100% coverage)
- Coverage Gap Analysis: 5 gaps identified (0 high, 2 medium, 3 low severity)
- 13 of 16 features have full automated coverage; 3 have partial coverage with documented gaps

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** Verification script checking matrix completeness
**Result:** All checks passing

**Verified:**
- No feature row has empty Test IDs column (16/16 rows populated)
- All 55 test catalog entries appear in at least one feature row (100% mapped)
- TEST-600 series gaps are intentional sparse numbering, not missing entries

*Verified by work action*
