# Move resume citations to separate file in zip download

## Full Verbatim Input

Please have look at file:///Users/sam/Downloads/submission-V28lTXf-IAdhlB2M9PNrkw/outputs/resume.html. It's obvious that the citations are cluttering up the resume itself and should be moved to a separate file in the zip package that's downloaded.
