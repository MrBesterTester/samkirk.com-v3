# Run All Tests and Fix Broken Ones

## What
Run the full test suite (unit tests via Vitest and E2E tests via Playwright). Identify any failing tests and fix the underlying issues causing failures.

## Context
- Unit tests: `npm test` (Vitest)
- E2E tests: `npx playwright test`
- Real LLM E2E: `npm run test:e2e:real`
- Fix the code causing test failures, not the tests themselves (unless the tests are genuinely wrong)

---
*Source: Please run all the tests and fix any that are broken.*

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear goal (run tests, fix failures) but need to discover what's actually broken. Need to explore test results first.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Clear task — run the test suites and fix any failures found. No architectural decisions needed, just need to discover what's broken.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- Ran full Vitest suite: 1,255 tests across 38 files — all passing
- Ran full Playwright E2E suite: 55 tests across 5 specs — all passing
- Total: 1,310 tests, zero failures
- No broken tests found — nothing to fix

*Generated by Explore agent*

## Implementation Summary

No code changes required — all 1,310 tests (1,255 unit + 55 E2E) are passing. The test suite is healthy.

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** `npm test` (Vitest) + `npx playwright test` (Playwright)
**Result:** ✓ All tests passing (1,255 unit + 55 E2E = 1,310 total)

**No failures found — no fixes needed.**

*Verified by work action*
