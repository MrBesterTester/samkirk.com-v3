# Persistent toolbar actions, remove quick-action modality

## Full Verbatim Input

Option 2: Move "Analyze My Fit" and "Generate Resume" into the persistent actions bar (top strip) so they're always available when a job is loaded and no flow is active. Remove the empty-state-only quick action chips from ChatStream. Simplify the "New Conversation" button to a small reset/clear icon instead of a labeled button, since it's no longer the gateway to re-accessing tools.
