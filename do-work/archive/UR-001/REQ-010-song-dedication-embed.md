## Blueprint Guidance
### 2.6 Add Song Dedication full embed

- **Goal**: Embed complete song dedication on home page
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - Lyrics display fully
  - Audio embed/link works
  - Styled consistently with page
- **Test plan**: Visual inspection, audio playback
- **Prompt**:

```text
Add Song Dedication section to home page:

- Embed the full content from /song-dedication page
- Include lyrics and audio player/link
- Style to fit the single-scroll home page aesthetic

Consider: Extract shared content to a component if duplicating between
home page and /song-dedication route.
```

## Context
- **Document set**: v2-upgrade
- **Phase**: 2 — Home Page Redesign
- **Specification**: See docs/v2-upgrade-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Opus 4.5 (advisory — use if your tool supports model selection)

## Dependencies

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Need to explore existing song-dedication page to understand content (lyrics, audio) before embedding on home page.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Clear goal (embed song dedication content) but need to discover what the existing /song-dedication page contains.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- **song-dedication page**: Exists at web/src/app/song-dedication/page.tsx with placeholder content (story, audio player placeholder, lyrics sections)
- **Content**: About text, audio player placeholder with Spotify/YouTube links, 3 lyric sections (Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2), song info footer
- **All content is placeholder** — no copyrighted material, safe to embed inline

*Generated by implementation agent (combined explore+implement)*

## Implementation Summary

- Added "Song Dedication" section to page.tsx between Photo Fun and Explore More
- Includes: about text, audio player placeholder, lyrics display (3 sections), song info footer
- Lyrics styled with whitespace-pre-line, chorus differentiated with bg-zinc-50
- Compact sizing (text-sm) to fit single-scroll aesthetic
- Link to full /song-dedication page at bottom
- All content is placeholder — matches existing song-dedication page

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** `npx vitest run src/app/page.test.tsx`
**Result:** ✓ 4/4 relevant tests passing (1 pre-existing failure unrelated)

*Verified by work action*
