## Blueprint Guidance
### 2.3 Add Hiring Manager tools section

- **Goal**: Preview + CTA for Fit, Resume, Interview tools
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - All three tools have preview cards
  - Interview Me includes sample Q&A exchange
  - CTAs link to respective tool pages
- **Test plan**: Click CTAs, verify navigation
- **Prompt**:

```text
Add Hiring Manager section to home page (web/src/app/page.tsx):

Section heading: "Hiring Manager?" (or similar)

Three ToolPreview cards:
1. How Do I Fit?
   - Description: Get a detailed fit analysis for your role
   - CTA: "Analyze Fit" → /tools/fit

2. Custom Resume
   - Description: Generate a tailored 2-page resume
   - CTA: "Generate Resume" → /tools/resume

3. Interview Me Now
   - previewContent: Sample Q&A (e.g., "Q: What's your experience with AI?")
   - CTA: "Start Interview" → /tools/interview

Layout: Grid on desktop, stack on mobile.
```

## Context
- **Document set**: v2-upgrade
- **Phase**: 2 — Home Page Redesign
- **Specification**: See docs/v2-upgrade-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Opus 4.5 (advisory — use if your tool supports model selection)

## Dependencies
Depends on REQ-006 (ToolPreview component must exist first).

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear section to add to page.tsx using existing ToolPreview component. Need to explore current page structure to find insertion point.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Well-defined section with 3 ToolPreview cards. Just need to see current page.tsx layout to find the right insertion point.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- **Key finding**: "Hiring Manager?" section already exists in page.tsx (lines 38-84) with hardcoded `<Link>` cards. Task is to refactor to use ToolPreview component.
- **Current grid**: `mt-8 grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-3` — 3 columns on desktop, stacked mobile
- **Current cards**: 3 hardcoded Link components for Fit, Resume, Interview with manual styling
- **ToolPreview** (components/ToolPreview.tsx): Props: title, description, previewContent?, ctaText, ctaLink, icon?
- **ToolPreview export**: Available from `web/src/components/index.ts`
- **Existing tests** (page.test.tsx lines 14-37): Test "Hiring Manager?" heading, all three tool links with correct hrefs
- **Interview card needs**: previewContent prop for sample Q&A exchange per blueprint

*Generated by Explore agent*

## Implementation Summary

- Refactored page.tsx Hiring Manager section from hardcoded `<Link>` cards to `<ToolPreview>` components
- Added import of ToolPreview from components barrel
- 3 cards: "How Do I Fit?" → /tools/fit, "Custom Resume" → /tools/resume, "Interview Me" → /tools/interview
- Interview card includes previewContent with sample Q&A about AI experience
- Section heading, subtitle, and grid layout preserved as-is
- Updated page.test.tsx to verify card headings + CTA links with new component structure

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** `npx vitest run src/app/page.test.tsx`
**Result:** ✓ 4/4 relevant tests passing (1 pre-existing failure unrelated — "renders welcome heading" from REQ-005 Hero redesign)

**Tests updated:**
- `web/src/app/page.test.tsx` — updated tool card test to verify h3 headings and CTA links

*Verified by work action*
