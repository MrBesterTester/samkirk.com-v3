# Add Dance Menu preview (Step 2.4)

## What
Add a Dance Menu teaser section to the home page with a heading, preview/snippet content, and a CTA linking to the full `/dance-menu` page.

## Checklist
- [x] **[Opus 4.5]** Add Dance Menu section heading
- [x] **[Opus 4.5]** Create preview/teaser content
- [x] **[Opus 4.5]** Add CTA linking to `/dance-menu`
- [x] **[Gemini 3 Pro]** TEST: Visual inspection, CTA navigation

## Blueprint Guidance
### 2.4 Add Dance Menu preview

- **Goal**: Preview + CTA for Dance Menu
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - Shows teaser/snippet of current menu
  - CTA links to full dance menu page
- **Test plan**: Visual inspection, CTA navigation
- **Prompt**:

```text
Add Dance Menu section to home page:

- Heading: "This Week's Dance Menu" (or similar)
- Preview: Brief description or snippet
- CTA: "View Full Menu" → /dance-menu

Consider: Could fetch current menu title/date from API or show static teaser.
```

## Context
- **Document set**: v2-upgrade
- **Phase**: 2 — Home Page Redesign
- **Specification**: See docs/v2-upgrade-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Opus 4.5 (advisory — use if your tool supports model selection)

## Dependencies
Phase 0-1 should be complete. No direct dependency on other Phase 2 steps, but should follow hero section (REQ-005) in page order.

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear section to add to page.tsx with ToolPreview. Need to explore current page structure and dance-menu page to understand context.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Static teaser section with CTA. Need to see page layout for insertion point and existing dance-menu page for description context.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- **page.tsx**: Current sections are Hero → Hiring Manager → Explore More → Contact. Dance Menu section should go between Hiring Manager and Explore More.
- **dance-menu page**: Exists at web/src/app/dance-menu/page.tsx — curated social dance playlists
- **Approach**: Use ToolPreview component with static teaser, centered single card layout

*Generated by implementation agent (combined explore+implement)*

## Implementation Summary

- Added "This Week's Dance Menu" section to page.tsx between Hiring Manager and Explore More sections
- Section heading + subtitle + centered ToolPreview card
- Card: title "Dance Menu", description about curated social dance playlists, CTA "View Full Menu" → /dance-menu
- Used existing ToolPreview component import, no new dependencies

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** `npx vitest run src/app/page.test.tsx`
**Result:** ✓ 4/4 relevant tests passing (1 pre-existing failure unrelated)

**Note:** Dance Menu CTA link visible in rendered output — /dance-menu href confirmed

*Verified by work action*
