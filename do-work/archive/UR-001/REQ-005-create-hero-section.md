## Blueprint Guidance
### 2.1 Create Hero section with photo

- **Goal**: Redesign hero with profile photo like v2
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - Photo appears upper-left on desktop, centered on mobile
  - Name, location, and tagline display properly
- **Test plan**: Visual comparison with v2, responsive testing
- **Prompt**:

```text
Redesign the hero section in web/src/app/page.tsx:

Structure:
- Relative container with photo positioned absolutely on desktop
- Photo: upper-left on md+ screens, centered and above text on mobile
- Text content: name, tagline about AI/ML and software engineering

Styling (like v2):
- Photo: w-40 md:w-48 rounded-lg border-4 border-blue-400/30 shadow-lg
- Responsive: flex justify-center md:block md:absolute md:left-0 md:top-0

Test: Compare side-by-side with v2 on both desktop and mobile.
```

## Context
- **Document set**: v2-upgrade
- **Phase**: 2 — Home Page Redesign
- **Specification**: See docs/v2-upgrade-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Opus 4.5 (advisory — use if your tool supports model selection)

## Dependencies

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear layout change but need to see current page structure.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- Current hero: text-center, h1 + p tagline (lines 7-15 of page.tsx)
- Photo available at `/profile-photo.jpg` (480x640 JPEG)
- Using Next.js Image component for optimization

*Generated by work action (inline exploration)*

## Implementation Summary

- Modified `web/src/app/page.tsx`:
  - Added `import Image from "next/image"`
  - Replaced centered text hero with flex layout (col on mobile, row on desktop)
  - Profile photo: w-40 md:w-48, rounded-lg, border-4 border-blue-400/30, shadow-lg
  - Mobile: photo centered above text
  - Desktop (md+): photo left, text right
  - Added name, "Fremont, California" location, and tagline

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** `npx next build`
**Result:** ✓ Build passes cleanly

*Verified by work action*
