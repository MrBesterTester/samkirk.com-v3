## What
Create a dedicated `/photo-fun` page with title, description of the AI photo editing app, features list, and a prominent CTA button linking to the external site. Add it to header navigation.

## Checklist
- [ ] **[Opus 4.5]** Create `web/src/app/photo-fun/page.tsx`
- [ ] **[Opus 4.5]** Add title, description, features list
- [ ] **[Opus 4.5]** Add prominent CTA button to external site
- [ ] **[Codex/Opus]** Add to Header navigation
- [ ] **[Gemini 3 Pro]** TEST: Navigation, link functionality

## Blueprint Guidance
### 3.1 Create Photo Fun link page

- **Goal**: Dedicated page for Photo Fun with description
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - Page exists at `/photo-fun`
  - Description of app and features
  - Prominent link to external site
- **Test plan**: Navigation, link functionality
- **Prompt**:

```text
Create web/src/app/photo-fun/page.tsx:

Content:
- Title: "Photo Fun"
- Description: AI-powered photo editing application using Google Gemini
- Features list:
  - 4 preset styles: Professional, Claymation, Cyberpunk, Pencil Sketch
  - Custom prompts for personalized transformations
  - Real-time image processing
- CTA: Large button linking to https://photo-fun.samkirk.com

Add to navigation in Header.tsx.
```

## Context
- **Document set**: v2-upgrade
- **Phase**: 3 — New Pages
- **Specification**: See docs/v2-upgrade-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Opus 4.5 (advisory — use if your tool supports model selection)

## Dependencies
Phase 0-2 should be complete. Header navigation update coordinates with REQ-012 (Tensor Logic also updates nav).

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** New page creation with header nav update. Need to explore Header.tsx nav pattern and check if photo-fun directory already exists.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Clear page spec with defined content. Need to discover Header nav pattern for adding new link.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- **Header.tsx**: Uses `baseNavLinks` array for navigation items, photo-fun added after Song Dedication
- **Existing page patterns**: song-dedication and dance-menu pages use max-w-4xl container, consistent card styling
- **photo-fun directory**: Already existed (App Router route)

*Generated by implementation agent (combined explore+implement)*

## Implementation Summary

- Created `web/src/app/photo-fun/page.tsx` with title, description, 3 features (preset styles, custom prompts, real-time processing), and prominent CTA button to https://photo-fun.samkirk.com
- Updated `web/src/components/Header.tsx` — added "Photo Fun" to baseNavLinks array
- CTA uses target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" for external link

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** `npx vitest run src/components/Header.test.tsx`
**Result:** ✓ 4/4 relevant tests passing (2 pre-existing failures for removed "admin" link)

*Verified by work action*
