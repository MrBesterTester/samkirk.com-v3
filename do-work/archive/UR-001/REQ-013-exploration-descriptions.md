# Add descriptions to Exploration pages (Step 3.3)

## What
Add introductory description sections to each existing exploration page (Category Theory, Pocket Flow, Dance Instruction, Uber Level AI Skills) above their static HTML content.

## Checklist
- [x] **[Opus 4.5]** Add description to Category Theory page
- [x] **[Opus 4.5]** Add description to Pocket Flow page
- [x] **[Opus 4.5]** Add description to Dance Instruction page
- [x] **[Opus 4.5]** Add description to Uber Level AI Skills page
- [x] **[Gemini 3 Pro]** TEST: Visual inspection of each exploration page

## Blueprint Guidance
### 3.3 Add descriptions to Exploration pages

- **Goal**: Add context/intro before static HTML content
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - Each exploration page has a description section
  - Static HTML content follows description
- **Test plan**: Visual inspection of each exploration page
- **Prompt**:

```text
Update exploration pages to add descriptions before static content:

1. /explorations/category-theory
   - Add intro explaining what Category Theory exploration covers

2. /explorations/pocket-flow
   - Add intro explaining Pocket Flow

3. /explorations/dance-instruction
   - Add intro about dance instruction content

4. /explorations/uber-level-ai-skills
   - Add intro about AI skills content

Pattern: Description section above the StaticHtmlViewer component.
```

## Context
- **Document set**: v2-upgrade
- **Phase**: 3 — New Pages
- **Specification**: See docs/v2-upgrade-SPECIFICATION.md for full requirements
- **Model recommendation**: Opus 4.5 (advisory — use if your tool supports model selection)

## Dependencies
No strict dependency on other Phase 3 steps. Can be done in parallel with REQ-011 and REQ-012.

## Triage

**Route: B** - Medium

**Reasoning:** Clear feature — expand description text on 4 existing pages. Need to understand the static HTML content to write appropriate intros.

**Planning:** Not required

## Plan

**Planning not required** - Route B: Exploration-guided implementation

Rationale: Simple content additions to existing pages. Pattern is already established.

*Skipped by work action*

## Exploration

- All 4 pages follow identical pattern: h1 title, single `<p>` description, then `<StaticHtmlViewer>` component
- Pages: category-theory, pocket-flow, dance-instruction, uber-level-ai-skills
- Current descriptions are just one line each — need to expand with more context about what the exploration covers

*Generated by work action (inline exploration)*

## Implementation Summary

- Expanded `web/src/app/explorations/category-theory/page.tsx` description — added context about functors, monads, and software architecture patterns
- Expanded `web/src/app/explorations/pocket-flow/page.tsx` description — added context about composability, LLM chaining, and multi-step pipelines
- Expanded `web/src/app/explorations/dance-instruction/page.tsx` description — added context about philosophy of instruction and learning principles
- Expanded `web/src/app/explorations/uber-level-ai-skills/page.tsx` description — added context about context management, refinement, and workflow design

*Completed by work action (Route B)*

## Testing

**Tests run:** `npx vitest run src/app/explorations`
**Result:** 5 test files, 15 tests passing

**Existing tests verified:** All exploration page tests pass with expanded descriptions.

*Verified by work action*
