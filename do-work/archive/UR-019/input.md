# Stale/incorrect chunks in vector DB producing wrong education in custom resume

## Full Verbatim Input

In my downloads folder there is donwload package from the Custom Resume function, custom-resume-Q470b135s6xkpXymNPyRxw.zip, which has really screwed up my education as I did not go to Stanford:
"Master of Science in Computer Science — Stanford University, 2014 Focus areas: Machine Learning, Distributed Systems. Thesis: "Efficient Training of Large-Scale Neural Networks on Distributed Infrastructure" Bachelor of Science in Computer Science — UC Berkeley, 2012 Graduated with honors. Member of ACM and IEEE student chapters. MS, Applied Math & Systems Sciences — University of Louisville, 1982 BA, Philosophy & Mathematics — Ohio State University, 1973
"
It looks like there are old chunks in the vector database that don't belong there.
