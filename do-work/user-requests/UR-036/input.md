# Separate Google billing accounts for samkirk-v3 and photo-fun

## Full Verbatim Input

I have two different projects in Google, one for this project and one for project, photo-fun, in ../photo-fun3. They need to have separate biling accounts so I can track their expenses seaprately. Please examine the account structure in Google to see if this is the case and make a plan to make it so if not.
