# Project: samkirk.com v3

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router) + React
- TypeScript (`strict: true`)
- Node.js runtime (backend is Next.js server routes on Cloud Run)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- LLM: Google Gemini via Vertex AI
- GCP hosting: Cloud Run (single full-stack service)
- Storage:
  - Cloud Storage (public + private buckets for files/artifacts)
  - Firestore (metadata, counters, rate limiting, spend tracking)

## Conventions
- **App location**: `web/` contains the Next.js app.
- **Type safety**: keep TypeScript strict; avoid `any`; validate untrusted inputs at API boundaries.
- **Secrets**: never commit secrets; use env vars / Secret Manager. Treat phone numbers for future SMS as secrets (do not log or expose).
- **Artifacts first-class**: persist inputs/outputs/citations for transparency per `docs/SPECIFICATION.md`, with 90-day retention.
- **Incremental delivery**: prefer small PR-sized changes with working pages/routes.

## Model preferences
- Frontend/UI: Claude Opus 4.5 (or equivalent high-end UI model)
- Backend/logic: GPT-5.2 (or equivalent)
- Debugging/visual testing: Gemini 3 Pro (or equivalent)

## Lessons learned
<!-- Add brief, information-dense entries when problems are solved -->
- **Avoid Gemini Pro 3 for file edits** (2026-02-03): Gemini Pro 3 overwrote `docs/GCP-SETUP.md` (900+ lines) with just 33 lines when asked to add Step 8 content. Only use Gemini Pro 3 when image processing is required; prefer other models for document editing.
