# Workflow Setup Guardrails

These rules prevent repeatedly missing (or duplicating) setup steps when starting a new project using `docs/Dylan-Davis-50plus-method.md`.

## Slash commands: global vs project

- **Git commands are global-only** — they live in `~/.cursor/commands/` and are shared across all repos. Do not create project-local copies.
- Before creating **global** slash commands, always **check whether they already exist** in `~/.cursor/commands/`.
- If global commands already exist, **do not overwrite them** unless the user explicitly asks to replace/update them.
- If global commands are missing, create them.
- Prefer creating **project-specific workflow** commands in `/.cursor/commands/` every new repo (safe and expected).

## Required global git commands (verify exist, create if missing)

- `~/.cursor/commands/git-commit-local.md` — commit to local repo only
- `~/.cursor/commands/git-remote-push-clean-with-squash.md` — squash-push to remote

## Setup checklist hygiene

- When you perform a setup step, immediately update the checklist in `docs/Dylan-Davis-50plus-method.md` (The Complete Workflow section):
  - mark the checkbox done
  - add a short “evidence” note (file exists / command ran)
