# Phase model reminder

When the user is starting or continuing a **phase** from `docs/Setup.md` (e.g. Phase 1 Specification, Phase 2 Blueprint, Phase 4 Development):

1. **Remind them which model to use** for that phase.
2. The recommended model is written under each phase heading in `docs/Setup.md` (source: `docs/Dylan-Davis-50plus-method.md`).

Do this in **every chat session**, including new ones—the user relies on this reminder so they can switch to the right model (e.g. ChatGPT Auto for spec, Claude Opus 4.5 for blueprint, or the task-specific model from TODO.md for development steps).
