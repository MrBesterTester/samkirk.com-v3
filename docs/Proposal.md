## Requirements
This is a proposal for an urgently needed personal website, samkirk.com, as a showcase of my genAI talent to attract attention and give credence to skills in genAI mainly for software development and explore my qualifications in software development using a chatbots. Note www.samkirk.com exists but is extremely outdated, so do NOT look at it. However, feel free to look at everything else I've referenced in this proposal.
- Refers to a few websites I've developed.
	- www.VillaMaduBali.com
	- www.tensor-logic.samkirk.com - Prof Domingos' unified language for machine learning
	- www.photo-fun.samkirk.com - So much better than old-fashioned, fun-house, optic distortion
- Allows for a weekly upload of my Dance Menu
	- Uploaded in a variety of format: .txt, .md, .html, .pdf, but always displayed .html.
	- Downloaded by the user in any of those formats. Note: the .txt format is best for txting.
- Features a song dedication to my mother - a remarkable example of music composition using  ChatGPT for the lyrics and www.udio.com for the sound track.
- Static, single-page explorations into
	- Category Theory - simple examples using common, everyday objects to build intuition
	- Pocket Flow - full GitHub page expose
	- Dance Instruction - detailed HTML document how I approach social, partner dancing for a beginner follower
	- Uber Level AI Skills from Nate B. Jones - Haven't tried it out yet.
- Important ideas for future development:
	- Dyad - practical engineering models in Julia using symbolic algebra
	- AlgebraicJulia.jl and DiagrammaticLearning.jl - Julia for rigorous scientific and machine learning models using Category Theory
- Examples of failures in my AI pilgrimage - GitHub repos
	- JobHunterAI - a costly mistake using API credit in Claude Code
	- Modular's Mojo Hackathon - fumble at the 2-yard line

The main feature of www.samkirk.com is set of chatbot functions:  "How Do I Fit?" "Get a Custom Resume," and "Interview Me Now" as follows:
- **How Do I Fit?**
	- Given the job opportunity, a report on the 3-way score of how I fit that job in three categories: well, average and poorly. 
- **Get a Custom Resume** - Allows visitor to paste a job opportunity and get a resume that customized to that given job opportunity. A great takeaway.
- **Interview Me Now** - Allows visitor to ask questions and make requests about my career and only about my career using a very detailed master resume as a RAG document.
    - See "/Users/sam/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Desktop/SAK Consulting/Resumes/Current Resumes/current_resume.md"
    as software engineering controlled document (but w/o a github repo).
A.ll discussions and artifacts can be downloadable in a choice of formats: .docx, .md, .pdf and .html (possibly with .svg drawings)

## Other References
This proposal is the third version of my personal website, www.samkirk.com. This is why the name of this project's root folder is samkirk.com-v3. The first version is on-line and is the one I've told you NOT to look at. There's a second, partial version here:
- /Users/sam/Projects/samkirk.com-v2

Please have a look at it with special attention on these file there: 
- Proposal-v2.md
- PRD-v2.md

Kindly disregard anything you see in samkirk-v2 which contradicts or is otherwise incompatible with the new version, samkirk-v3, which you are presently working on. In effect, samkirk-v2 is to be understood as suggestions, not requirements.  The requirements for samkirk-v3 are simply everything in this proposal above this section, Other References, in the section above titled Requirements.
