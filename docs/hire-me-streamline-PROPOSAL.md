# Hire Me Streamline — Proposal

> Original request from the user, filed as-is for reference alongside the Specification, Blueprint, and TODO.

---

The UI for Hire Me is still "modally" and lacking a unification for streamlined, efficient use. The Home page still shows three separate modes and the Hire Me tab still shows three separate subpages. However due to recent work, the actual presentation manages to share a single, uploaded job description between the How Do I Fit? and Custom Resume. However, the user must switch pages to get to the other function of the two once one has been selected. That said, the good news is that chat conversation can still be had even after the preset function has been exercised.

I do not want separate pages, but just one page jumped off from the home page so that on the home page, there will be but one link under the Hiring Manager? annotation and the other three sections on the home page about How Do I Fit?, Custom Resume, and Interview me NOW will have none. Likewise, there should be no subpages to the Hire Me tab.
